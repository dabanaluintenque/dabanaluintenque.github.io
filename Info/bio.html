           I am majoring in computer science minor in math statistics and African studies.
           I was born in Guinea Bissau, a small country in West Africa. Extended by Senegal in the south, Guinea Conakry to the North and East, and the Atlantic Ocean in the west. 
           I attended Brockton high school from September 2017 to June 2019. I did have a wonderful experience at Brockton high school because everything was new to me.
           I came to Bridgewater State University in September 2019. I lived in Woodward in my first year.
           During my first year, I signed for different clubs. Such as Math, honor, and Bible study.
