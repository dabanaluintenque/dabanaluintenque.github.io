            I was born in Guinea Bissau, a small country in West Africa. Extended by Senegal in the south, Guinea Conakry to the North and East, and the Atlantic Ocean in the west. 
            I came to the United States in May 2017. With goals to meet my dad and fulfill my dream in the United States. May 2017 was the first time that I saw my dad physically. I did not know my dad personally because he had left my country for a better condition in life to immigration month before I was born. After he left a couple of years later, my moon passed away.  
             I attended Brockton high school from September 2017 to June 2019. I did have a wonderful experience at Brockton high school because everything was new to me. Country, people, school, and language. While attending Brockton high school, I was working at Wendy's main street Brockton. I later become the restaurant supervisor at Wendy's for less than two years. That was another wonderful experience in my life. I get to know people there and learn how many people think when they are hungry and other things. 
              I came to Bridgewater State University in September 2019 during my first year I lived in Woodward, and I signed to different clubs, Math, honor student, and Bible study where I meet great people that later help me change the way how I think, make myself more valuable and to be hungry to do wonderful things in life. I am currently double majoring in computer science and mathematics minor in African studies and statistics. 
           Unfortunately, I left my job at Wendy's in November 2020 to pursue my goals and my dream at Bridgewater State University. Which is to become one of the best app and web developer and desktop designers, and I will do it if Lord God willing. 
        Fortunately, when I left Wendy's, I was hired by the math department to serve my Bridgewater State University community as a tutor. I like the tutor job. Because it helps me to be ready all the time in the problem-solving skills, work with others and get closer to my dream. I am also part of the "Honor Student Vice President Advisor Board Meetings." 
         In life, nothing is easy. But we must keep pushing ourselves every day. One day, we will get where we want to go. Never give up. I believe we are the future.
